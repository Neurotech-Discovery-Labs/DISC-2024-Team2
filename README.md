This project was conducted using the Delsey's Trigno EMG devices to allow for the control of a cursor on the screen as the muscles were flexed on the wrist. 
The intuitive task file is one in which the cursor on the screen will move in the direction that the wrist is flexed.
The unintuitive file is one in which the cursor on the screen will move in a different direction than that of which the wrist is flexed.
